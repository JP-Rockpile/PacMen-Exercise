# PacMen-Exercise

This program works using 2 buttons. First the add Pacman button adds a new pacman character to the screen which are all held in the same array. When the start game button is pressed, random velocities in both the x and y direction are assigned to each individual pacman character that was created. Pacmen are constrained within the size of the window viewing the program. Repeatedly pressing start game will continue to add random velocities onto each pacman. 

Roadmap of future improvements: Right now the Pacmen is generated with a default picture of PacMan1.png. An improvement to make in the future is to create a function using setInterval that changes the newimg.src in sequence from PacMan1.png to PacMan4.png. Another improvement that could be made is to add sound effects or add power pellets and have the pacmen follow and try to eat power pellets. Another improvement might be to add a stop game or reset game button. Aside from Javascript, this program could be improved using some basic CSS that creates a game board for the Pacmen.
